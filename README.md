cowsay is a configurable talking cow, originally written in Perl by [Tony Monroe](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay)

It was translated to JavaScript from the original program by [Fabio Crisci](https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay)

This project is an adaptation of cowsay but instead it randomly outputs characters from the Batman universe and some of their famous quotes

### Contribution

Please feel free to fork it and contribute. Whether by suggesting new features or simply adding characters from the batman universe with their quotes.

## Install

    npm install -g batmansay

## Usage

  To randomly select a character from the batman universe one of their quotes
    batmansay

  To list the available characters
    batmansay -l

  To display a specific character
    batmansay -f joker

  To let the character say the custom text after the command and the options if passed
    batmansay my custom text

  ![JOKER](https://github.com/meeshh/batmansay/blob/master/images/joker.png?raw=true)

or

  replace `batmansay` of the above commands with `batmanthink`

The `batmanthink` command shows the characters as if they are thinking instead of saying something

You can also run `batmansay -h` for help

Feel free to add the command to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` files so you can have a character greeting when you first open your shell.
